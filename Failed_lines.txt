780,05-18-2013,Lucinda,Manning,Ossining,"New York","United States","My parent had LASIK with many complications (bad night vision, floaters, halos, and close focus problems) and has developed cataracts which prevents reading -- one of the great joys of life.  We now know that LASIK eye surgery was not fully tested, is improperly regulated for safety concerns, and is now proving to have been too dangerous for long-term eye health. STOP LASIK surgery now.  I agree with the FDA Citizen Petition to: 1. Withdraw FDA approval (PMA) for all LASIK devices 2. AND, to issue an immediate Public Health Advisory with a voluntary recall of LASIK devices.  We must stop the eye LASIK industry from permanently harming even more individuals' eyes in the coming years." 781,05-20-2013,J,Lopez,Fresno,California,"United States","I had LASIK and have never gotten rid of my glasses, have chronic dry eye which was never a problem prior to LASIK, have night vision issues and have now developed cataracts. My vision since LASIK has been a fluctuating nightmare. I could never wear prescription glasses after the surgery as my vision changed from day to day. This procedure should be BANNED."

895,01-17-2014,Brandon,Fresard,Houston,Texas,"United States","Before lasik, I was such a happy person.  I led a normal life and was planning on getting married.  I never had a dry eye issue with my glasses before lasik.  Now, I am in pain everyday.  I can no longer work.  I have spent tens of thousands of dollars attempting to correct my chronic dry eye.  The money is meaningless to me, I just want to not be in pain anymore and go back to how things were.  I am considering suicide.   I hate how people can say one incident cannot cause a person to commit suicide.  Here's the thing, lasik was a one day thing, but the burning and the pain is every day.  Every single day, almost all day for me.  Can that cause a person to want to commit suicide?  It has for me.  I wish everyone who is pro lasik could be afflicted with burning and pain in their eyes like I have everyday.  Would they still then tout lasik?  This is torture.   If you call dry eye a side effect when it prevents you from working, prevents you from enjoying life, and causes you to keep your eyes closed for 10 to 16 hours a day when before you were a happy person, you cannot distinguish the difference between a side effect and an injury.  Why doesn't the FDA go ahead and call blindness and every other injury a side effect too?  That way lasik could have a 0% injury rate and only side effects." 896,01-24-2014,Carla,McAfee,Boise,Idaho,"United States","Because I am going blind. I had Lasik in 1996, or what I thought I had done.  Come to find out, they did RK in both eyes.  I then needed an inhancement 2 years later.  Since then my eyes have gotten so bad, I can't see to put on makeup.  1 1/2 yr ago, I had cataract surgery in my right eye, right over the RK incisions, I now have found out that is a definite no no.  I feel like I am looking through petroleum jelly, and it keeps getting worse each day.  I am seeing an optomoligist on Monday 1/27.  I want him to tell me, no holes barred what is happening to my eyes.  I will be doing research to see what I can do, or if I have any recourse."
