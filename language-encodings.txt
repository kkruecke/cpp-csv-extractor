ASCII is an single bytes, seven-bit encoding. There are other single byte, eight-bit encodings that extend ASCII like the 8859-X family of character encodings.
These include:

8859-1 or Latin 1
8859-2 or Latin 2

Latin 1 is the most popular. It includes code points for most western European languages, including the Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, German, Italian, and Spanish. It includes most of 
French with the exception of about two letters, for which there are workarounds.
