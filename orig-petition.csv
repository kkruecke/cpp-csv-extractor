Patients who need urgent eye care must wait for months, whilst potential lasik victims get an immediate, free consultation. Despite the fact that this lasik center creates so many new dry eye cases every year, the ""doctors"" there know nothing about dry eye nor are they willing to learn.  These doctors refuse to provide me with even the most basic dry eye care, and because they have eliminated all the small opthalmologists from the city I have nowhere to go.

However, everyone at the practice denies that this is a complication of LASIK.  I have been given many excuses: that it's normal, age-related (I was 34) , they've always been there, that only notice them because I'm paying more attention to my vision, that the floaters will ""settle down after a while"", that I'll get used to them.  It's been 17 months and they're not gone.  I was never this unhappy with my pre-op nearsightedness. I would take back my pre-op eyes in a heartbeat, if only I could, but the floaters aren't treatable.  I also have some night glare.  I'm sure my surgeon counts me as a ""success"" when advertising his LASIK mill to prospective patients.

There has to be a full investigation by the FDA into the safety and efficacy of Lasik. In a large percentage of patients, it has proven neither safe not effective. Furthermore, those providing the safety data at present have inherent conflicts since they stand to lose huge profits by exposing the dangers of this surgery. Ditto the instrument companies involved. This requires a similar investigation to that done for Celebrex. It is a scourge on the medical profession and will go down in history as that.

They said having them removed would worsen my eyesight. I have had my tear ducts permanently plugged and use eye drops every day yet my eyes are painfully dry. During my last visit I overheard my doctor talking with an assistant about my eyes damaged by Lasik. When he came back into the room I insisted he tell me if that was what is causing my problems with glare and dry eyes. He said it was and put me on two additional medications for the eyes. I have researched this problem and discovered Lasik has damaged millions of patients eyes. This procedure should not be allowed. I'm only 62 and have 20/15 vision yet I cannot see at night when meeting cars or looking at lights. The results of this procedure are not reversable and patients, like me, would have never had this done if we knew this would happen to us."

I've had three surgeries on my left eye, one to treat a condition before I even had Lasik (this should probably have been a warning sign to the doctor), one for the initial Lasik and one to ""fine tune"" the eye (the dominant eye) afterwards.  I've had problems with severe dry eye in the left eye periodically and it's now becoming worse and quite frequent.

So I went to get Lasik, with supposedly one of the best Lasik surgeons in Austin at the time, Stephen Dell. I deemed the surgery a miracle. Within minutes I had 20/10 vision in my left eye and 20/20 vision in my right eye. Sadly within 2 years of the surgery, I developed mild astigmatism. At that time Dr. Dell said that I was ready to get a surgical enhancement. He recommended that I had the surgery with “a new machine that corrected astigmatism” for an additional $1,000 or for free with the old machine since my initial surgery was guaranteed for life. I declined a second surgery because I wanted to use the new machine and did not have the $1,000 at that time. On my 3rd year after lasik, I was ready to have a 2nd surgery. however, when Dr. Dell did the pre-surgical test, he said, “you are no longer a candidate for an enhancement. The Shape of your cornea has changed, probably because you rub your eyes or due to hormonal changes.” He did not tell me 1) that the astigmatism was caused by the surgery and 2) that I had developed ectasia. Instead he prescribed eye drops for glaucoma because according to him the drops could change the shape of my cornea,  making me a good candidate for surgery again.  Luckily, I had a severe adverse reaction to the glaucoma eye drops, and urgently went to see one of Dr. Dell’s associate, Dr. Sargent. She was clearly put off by the glaucoma treatment as well as the suggestion that I could have Lasik again by using glaucoma eye drops, and strongly suggested that I forget about Lasik. I did forget about Lasik and my vision continued to degenerate at a slow rate. I would get a new prescription every 2 years. Whenever, I asked why is my vision worse than before Lasik, the Dell associate kept saying that it must be because I was rubbing my eyes in my sleep.   Not undergoing the second surgery most likely saved my sight,  my uncle remarked as well as Dr. Wang. Nevertheless, the process of Ectasia could have been delayed if I had worn appropriate contacts early on.  In other words, Dell Associates knew what was going on and didn’t diagnose me"

No ONE said it could be this bad!!! Swervy world, loss of contrast, ghosty line around people. squares aren't square, circles aren't round,, things aren't clear... and it costs a boatload of money to get any contact that even help. It doesn't fix it all, but helps,,, and I will have to worry about being fit for lenses for the rest of my life.! My irregular corneas cannot be fit with regular hard or soft lenses.. But only with contacts that overall cost thousand of dollars and add more cost every couple years to get replacements.. And The emotional trauma I went through and the daily PAIN I go through still (cuz you can't escape it) every day.. You can't heal from it, because it's right in front of you every waking minute.  This needs to be banned.. I've met too many others personally myself that have been harmed. If I am only ONE person and meeting so many, you know how many others are out there, besides the one on this petition. Not every harmed know there is a petition. And think of those who really NEED corneal transplants.. we can't donate our eyes, and some of us have to use the transplants that others could have, because now our eyes are so totally damaged.  I'm just soooo angry!!!! And pray that it is stopped!!! I am so sorry to all of you who have been through what I have.. So sorry!!

     January 2007. After graduating from college, I accept to do LASIK myopia surgery. 1200 degrees of myopia before surgery. After surgery the abnormal dry eyes. A month after the surgery, my left eye began to be uncomfortable together. The left side of the head is not comfortable, that will get better over time, but did not, and it is more and more serious. That time the eyes eyelids feel no serious tear of lubrication left eye than the right eye. But not in pain, eyelid not broken, so that time does not particularly care about. Never know what is dry eye. Because dry eye phenomenon never had before surgery. The postoperative corneal a neurotomy perception reduce corneal did not feel dry and hot. But the upper and lower eyelids often becomes inflamed, bloodshot. Six months after surgery eyes slowly began to ache. The eyes are very dry eyes like a stinging pain morning, and almost earned not open our eyes. Even worse is very serious pain in the left eye, and along with the left side of a headache. The left eye often tears, and often pain blinded. Eyes closed, lying on the bed, his left eye is still very uncomfortable. Every day, there can not be normal learning and working. How can not get out when feeling left cornea and left eye, upper and lower eyelid and the left side of the head daily pain, like a knife bar from the eyes to the head, like a left eye eyes inside a small stone mill to rub off . Time every day, can not sleep, frequent insomnia, can not rest, eyes closed, unable to relieve pain. Sleep until 3 o'clock to 4 o'clock every day will be the left eye pain and headache to wake up, and could no longer sleep. The left side of his head is feeling the same pain like cramps. Headache until today left eye pain and left the light weight, serious when there is no way to be alleviated only hard with the palm of your hand to press the left eye and squeeze the left cornea. Serious when trying to dig out the left eye to freed. Often feel eyes closed roll his eyeballs sometimes more than open eyes uncomfortable. Blink more painful than not blink. That time often check my eyes and the upper and lower eyelids. Because the left side of the lower eyelid dry eye, left eye damage and ulcers. Left eye eyelid is more than the right eye redness. The eyelids also very swollen. And headaches that may have a direct relationship. Left eye pain and headache then to now has not been much improvement. Until August 24, 2011, there were some changes. Since that day I did lasik the secondary left eye corrective surgery. The left cornea eccentric irregular asymmetrical get a little bit of correction, but after surgery to improve pain and dry eye effect. The postoperative left eye pain and headache alleviate. Although left eye morphogenetic get a little improvement after the second surgery, left eye pain and headaches improved than before, but corneal shape has not been fundamentally changed. The problem persists - my left eye is still pain and accompanied by a headache, but lighter than before. 8 months after corneal morphology rollback. The curvature of the cornea above seems to increase. Schirmer coating seems to have problems, aggravate dry eyes and headaches. The pain remains a serious problem affecting my life - during the day and does not work learning, the night is not normal sleep. Sleep around 5:00, I will be left eye pain and headaches wake-up to, and can no longer sleep in pain every day. Although pain than the previous three or four o'clock in the morning we wake up stronger. But the whole body is still getting worse, the body immunity getting worse. From 2007 to today, my life has been unable to take care of themselves, have been required family members to take care of every day still does not sleep. Although the daily difficulties and eye pain and headaches affect sleep sleep, will not be able to work and learn. From 2007 to today, the binocular vision is very bad. Poor night vision. The nighttime glare very serious, was able to go out walking and driving. More do not know the road, at night is very difficult depending on the material. Now the left eye is still about 150 degrees of hyperopia and astigmatism of more than 150 degrees. 

    I I have a love of philosophy and art. Young people a love of life and thinking.I once wrote a philosophical treatise of thirty thousand words ""Art, the presence of vitality."" Has a profound insight into the human vitality. I had a dream to be a philosophy professor. But in January 2007, everything changed. The postoperative left eye pain and headaches so I have no way Rethinking macro-proposition of the life of the universe. Able to survive normal eating and sleeping is my proposition. If the instinct of these people need to be very difficult, then what is contributing to society? Everything thinking around my disease. I was seeking a variety of ways to just quickly put my cure. From 2007 to August 2011. Four years, traveled to hospitals across the country for medical treatment. Help many many doctors doctor. Help over including ophthalmology, sinus Division, Department of Neurology, Neurology, Immunology, liver and kidney Branch spine Branch, dental, etc.. Systemic done several checks, including full-body CT repeatedly, the brain CT multiple sinus CT several immune five checks several times, rheumatic detection times, blood urine test repeatedly, spinal X-rays, chest X-ray optic nerve detection, head of neurological tests many times and so on, without any problem. Even try to do the sinuses abscess surgery. Since then left eye pain and headache thought it was a sinus cysts cause, so do unnecessary surgery. No improvement at after regret. Order the cure spent nearly 300,000 yuan of money, but still to no avail. The left eye pain on the left headache still not seen any improvement. Although the body has done repeatedly over the checks are no problem, but the eye examination several times to check out the dry eye and eccentric cutting. Eyes in each hospital to check his eyes after LASIK dry eye. Wenzhou Eye Hospital check: the bottom of the right cornea often punctate staining, the bottom of the left cornea sustained punctate, strip, sheet stained. The binocular eye conjunctiva nipple hyperplasia, such as conjunctiva small follicles. The double tear film is incomplete. The binocular basal tear test right eye for the 7mm, 4mm left eye. Tear film breakup time right eye but = 1 second left tear film breakup time but = 0 seconds; checks, Beijing Tongren Hospital: eyes the basal tear test right eye 7mm, left eye 5 mmBut the left tears membrane is not complete; the Guangzhou Zhongshan Ophthalmic Hospital test: corneal limbus below the left and right side the visible large number of point-like staining FL (+); ENT Hospital of Fudan University, checks, experts believe that my left eye after LASIK surgery irregular eccentric cutting, so the cause of dry eye symptoms. The Professor of Beiyisanyuan think my left eye pain and headaches and visual fatigue. Hyperopia, astigmatism, glare can cause a recurring visual fatigue and headaches discomfort; doctor thinks double cornea after my LASIK surgery asymmetric index is high. Than before surgery, the cornea was more irregular asymmetric morphology. Partial left eye cornea center cutting can cause eye fatigue can also lead to severe dry eye; doctors think I corneal nerves has not yet returned to normal levels, they believe that the general postoperative year corneal nerve basic recovery, but some people need to longer; doctors believe excimer cutting more than 1,000 degrees of myopia center of the cornea is too flat, too steep surrounding. Reduction of central corneal curvature and increased peripheral corneal curvature, the tension and Pressure of the eyelids on the cornea concentrated in the periphery of the cornea, rather than central. So the eyelid  no better oppression central corneal makes central corneal sensitivity reduced sensitivity to reduced tear secretion. This is more apparent in the corneal topography of the comparison of the left-eye and right-eye. Combined with the left eye eccentric Consumers cut the lead to severe dry eye caused by tear film coating uneven. Some The doctor thinks my left eye corneal topography on top of curvature change too suddenly. Curvature of the cornea soon change from 43D to 33D. The transition from the short and not likely to cause the upper eyelid blink uneven corneal tension and tear coating uneven. Plus the central cornea perception lower decrease in tear secretion. The periphery of the cornea steep, easily eyelid to form a larger tension and friction of the cornea steep, easy to aggravate dry eye symptoms and headaches.     
    
In short, this non-human suffering all day torment haunt me, I can not stand. I do not want to die relief. Do not want to put their own eye dug to relieve the pain. I have always felt that there is still hope. Is blind Well than this pain. Is replaced the cornea also did not like me so painful ah. At least not like me because of left eye pain and headache, there dry eye seriously affect sleep ah! I traveled all over the country to find a lot of doctors, they do not have a good way, The doctor will say: like me, only to find the first time you do lasik surgery doctor to help you solve. They would say: do the surgery in which hospital you go to which hospital they give you. I find many of my surgeon and his hospital, they did not have any way, and very irresponsible to tell me: My question and their operation does not matter。I really have nowhere to get consultation and treatment desperation. So request you kindly doctor to help me, I really have the heart of the removal of the eye. I hope that doctors consider surgery to help me solve the problem, including lamellar keratoplasty surgery. I hope to restore some of the central corneal thickness and central curvature doctor who can help me to save my eyes, no matter what way. If the surgery can be restored. Then surgery all risks and consequences to be borne by the patient himself, can a lawyer do notary. I hope the doctor who canceled the concerns and worries. Help me to improve central corneal morphology. Now because of eye problems, because the night unable to sleep, the body is getting worse, trance memory decline. My immune system is getting worse each organ problems, it seems there are problems with the body's metabolism. My wife is very good, she was always there for me to take care of me and help me. The more so the more I feel guilty. Her into trouble because of my illness. Sometimes I really want to walk away from the pain. But I am worried that my family would feel sorry for me. Worried about my wife alone and helpless. The family always encouraged me to let me brave and strong in the face of difficult! I remind myself all the time my illness is getting better. But again and again the active treatment and in exchange fail again and again. Again and again to seek medical treatment, but in exchange for a second doctor who cold-shoulder treatment. I hope to win and beliefs do not know how long it can hold?

   My sister has also done a lasik surgery for myopia. We do the surgery in a hospital.600 degrees of myopia before her surgery.After her surgery and some dry eye syndrome.But after six months to disappear soon improved.My cousin did the lasik surgery for myopia, myopia 500 degrees before surgery.The basic symptoms of dry eye after surgery.Many of my friends also done lasik myopia Surgery.Their pre-operative are basically 500-600 degrees of myopia, 100-200 degrees of astigmatism.Within one year after surgery, dry eye symptoms have disappeared.I was the only the highest myopia, up to 1100 degrees.Postoperative only my dry eye has not improved.And getting worse.   .From 2007 to today, the past five years, I have used countless ways to the treatment of left eye pain headache and dryeye. The doctor's advice with lot many ways no better but to no avail. Over the past five years including the use of a variety of artificial tears. Including imports of preservative-free artificial tears. Ten minutes with artificial tears. For example the Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium Eye Drops times contingent, Dextran70Eye Drop, Refresh, URSAPHARTM Arzne Hycosan bought countless but the effect is minimal. Has been used the lacrimal embolism - including tears of the Smart Plug and tear duct plugs used many times and no improvement. There are contact lenses, with the the the zero mirror and RGP protect the cornea Medical, the result is more wear worse, can not be tolerated. Has always insisted on using eyedrops - including a variety of anti-inflammatory drugs and surrounded neomycin improved, used hundreds of anti-inflammatory drugs, but with much more dry eyes. Oral medications - with Chinese medicine including western medicine to stimulate tear secretion and Yin and enrich blood effect. Only slightly ease the symptoms of dry eye, but not of much help to alleviate the left eye pain. Moreover, long-term medication appears significant side effects, and a threat to other organs. Eat traditional Chinese medicine has been insisting for nearly two years. Dry eye pain, but can not solve the problem. Health care products - always insisted on eating a variety of vitamins and lutein, as if no effect. Adhere eaten for some time, analgesic drugs and psychotropic drugs - including various antidepressant anxiolytics and Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine to promote sleep, in addition to the brain unresponsive, eye pain and therefore alleviate. Contrary eat these drugs more dry eyes. The treatment of dry eye include Chinese acupuncture and fumigation by grinding and eye - including eye acupuncture and body acupuncture conditioning, but no substantial improvement in the left eye pain and headache problems. However, I seem to comfort. Also include a variety of physical therapy, the left eye ocular anti-inflammatory therapy, the effect is very short-lived. The above method can not improve pain problems. The left eye pain and left headache and still can not be mitigated. Serious still use the palm of your hand to press the cornea and the eye to relieve the pain and headache. Submandibular gland transplant ever wanted to do to ease the most frustrating case. It is a major surgery, the mouth is very dry after transplantation. Doctors do not recommend that I do so, because of the lacrimal gland and tear secretion is good. They think my problem is that the shape of the cornea. The fact that, as they say：my question exactly corneal shape.

     On August 24, 2011, I do left eye secondary lasik surgery. It is guided treatment of hyperopia and astigmatism, corneal topography (T-CAT) LASIK surgery. Corneal shape after only a little change, but it was to improve left eye pain and headaches as well as to improve the effect of dry eye is very obvious. Sleep also improved a lot. Later, I proposed to the doctor again lasik surgery. Vision, I do not consider. 1200 degrees of myopia even back to 2007 years ago, I was very happy. I am also very pleased to wear thick glasses. The key is to corneal shape. But the doctor said I corneal thickness has few remaining. In this case, I think a to do corneal stroma microlens filled surgical implantation. Femtosecond lenticule re-implantation transplant a lenticule.  Is to cut the corneal supplemented back. Although it is not possible to completely do as morphology before lasik surgery back in 2007. But I think if you restore some form of increased central corneal curvature can be a good solution to my problem. To correct a little eccentric cutting. Lamellar transplantation the corneal technology has been very mature, allograft the corneal rejection probability is very low, not to mention micron calculate the thickness of the cornea corneal microlens. I want to fill my original corneal flap corneal microlens to improve my cornea forms a 600-800 degrees. As before people do 500-600 degrees of myopia lasik surgery, very few people will have to dry eye, corneal topography and central corneal curvature and has not changed much. Problem will do lasik surgery myopia above 1000 degrees. As the doctor said central corneal curvature is too low causes the eyelid tension and pressure is concentrated in the periphery of the cornea, rather than central. Restore central corneal curvature to reduce peripheral curvature fundamental improvements in tear distribution. If filling ineffective also can take down. If you fill really solve my problem until it becomes better and better, then my life is no longer a tragedy! Future and hope no longer slim! Moreover, this method can help more people who need help!


一封求救信

     2007年1月。大学毕业后，我接受做LASIK近视手术。手术前1200度近视。手术后双眼干燥异常。手术后一个月，我的左眼开始难受起来。左边头部也不舒服，以为过段时间就会好，可是没有，而且是越来越严重。那个时候双眼眼睑感觉无泪液润滑左眼比右眼严重。但并不是很疼，眼睑也没有破损，所以那时候没有特别在意。以前从不知道什么是干眼症。因为在手术前从来没有过干眼现象。术后角膜神经切断知觉降低角膜没有感到干燥和炙热。但是上下眼睑经常充满血丝变得红肿。手术后半年双眼开始慢慢疼痛起来。当时眼睛非常干躁，早晨起床时双眼如针刺般疼痛，几乎挣不开眼睛。更为要命的是左眼疼痛非常严重，并且伴随着左侧头疼。左眼经常流泪，时常疼得睁不开眼睛。闭着眼躺在床上左眼依然非常难受。每天如此，根本无法正常学习和工作。那时候感觉左眼角膜和左眼上下眼睑和左边头部每天疼痛难忍，像有刀子从眼睛扎到脑袋里，又像左眼眼睛里进去了小石头磨来磨去怎么也出不来。那时候每天都无法安睡，经常失眠，无法休息，闭眼也无法缓解疼痛。每天睡到凌晨3点到4点钟就会被左眼疼痛和头疼的叫醒来，再也无法安睡。左边脑袋感觉像抽筋一样疼痛难忍。直到今天左眼疼痛和左边头疼时轻时重，严重时毫无办法，只能用手掌使劲按压左眼球和挤压左角膜加以缓解。严重时想把左眼球挖出来得以解脱。时常感觉到闭着眼转动眼球有时比睁着眼更难受。眨眼比不眨眼更痛苦。那个时候经常检查我双眼的上下眼睑。因为干眼，左眼下眼睑的左边有破损和溃疡。左眼上眼睑比右眼则更加红肿。眼皮也很肿胀。那可能和头疼有直接关系。左眼疼痛和头疼从那时到现在一直没有多少好转。直到2011年8月24日有一些改变。因为那天我做了lasik二次左眼矫正手术。左眼角膜偏心不规则不对称得到一点点的矫正，但术后改善疼痛和干眼症效果明显。术后左眼疼痛和头疼减轻一些。虽然二次手术后左眼形态得到一点改善，左眼疼痛和头疼虽然比以前好转一些，但角膜形态并没有得到根本改变。问题依然存在——现在我的左眼仍然疼痛并伴随着头疼，只是比以前轻一些。10个月后角膜形态回退。角膜上方曲率似乎增加一些。泪液分泌涂布似乎又出现问题，干眼和头疼加重。疼痛问题依然严重影响我的生活——白天无法正常工作学习，夜晚无法正常睡眠。每天睡眠到凌晨5点左右我就会被左眼疼痛和头疼叫醒来，再也无法安睡，痛苦不堪。虽然比之前凌晨三四点钟疼醒来要强些。但整个身体还是越来越差，身体免疫力也越来越差。从2007年到今天，我的生活一直无法自理，一直需家人照顾，每天仍然无法正常睡眠。虽然每天很困顿，但眼睛疼和头疼影响的就是睡不好觉，更无法工作和学习。从2007年到今天，双眼视力也非常不好。夜晚的视力很差。夜间眩光非常严重。无法外出行走和开车。看不清楚路。夜晚视物非常困难。现在左眼仍有有150度左右的远视和150多度的散光。

    我曾经是一个热爱哲学与艺术。一个热爱生命与思考的青年。我曾写过三万字哲学论文《艺术、存在、生命力》。对人类生命力有着深刻洞悉的人。我曾梦想做一名哲学教授。但是一切都在2007年1月份被改变了。术后的左眼疼痛和头疼使我无从再思考生命宇宙之类的宏观命题了。能够正常的生存吃饭睡觉才是我最大的命题。如果实现这些人的本能需要都很困难，那么何谈奉献社会呢？所有的一切思考都围绕着我的疾病而展开。我那时寻求着各种办法只想着赶紧把我的病治好。从2007年到2011年8月。四年来，为了治病跑遍了全国各地医院。求助过很多很多医生大夫。求助过包括眼科，鼻窦科，神经科，脑科，免疫科、肝肾科，脊椎骨科，牙科等等。全身做过多次检查，包括全身CT多次，脑CT多次，鼻窦CT多次，免疫五项检查多次，风湿性检测多次，血液尿液检查多次，脊椎X光，胸部X光，视神经检测，头部神经检查多次等等，都没有任何问题。甚至为此还做了鼻窦脓肿手术。因为当时左眼疼痛和头疼以为是鼻窦囊肿造成，所以做了不必要的手术。可术后没有一点好转很后悔。为了治病花了将近30万元钱，但依然徒劳无功。左眼疼痛左边头疼仍然未见任何好转。虽然全身多次做过各项检查都无问题，但是眼部检查却多次检查出干眼症和偏心切削。眼睛在各医院检查为双眼LASIK术后干眼症。温州眼视光医院检查为：右眼角膜下方经常点状染色，左眼角膜下方持续点状，条状，片状染色。双眼眼睑结膜乳头增生，结膜小滤泡等。双眼泪膜不完整。双眼基础泪液测试右眼为7mm，左眼为4mm。但泪膜破裂时间右眼but=1秒，左眼泪膜破裂时间but=0秒；北京同仁医院检查为：双眼基础泪液测试右眼为7mm，左眼为5mm, 
但左眼泪膜不完整；广州中山眼科医院测试为：左右侧角膜下方巩缘可见大量点状染色FL(+)；复旦大学五官科医院检查后专家认为我的左眼LASIK手术后有不规则和偏中心切削。所以造成干眼不适症状。北医三院教授认为我左眼疼痛和头疼与视疲劳有关。远视、散光、眩光可以导致经常性视疲劳和头疼不适；还有医生认为我LASIK手术后双眼角膜非对称指数偏高。角膜比术前呈更多不规则不对称形态。左眼偏角膜中心切削可以造成视力疲劳也可以导致严重干眼；还还有医生认为我的角膜神经还没有恢复到正常水平，他们认为一般患者术后一年角膜神经基本恢复，但有些人需要更长时间；有医生认为1000度近视以上准分子切削使角膜中央过于平坦周边过于陡峭。中央角膜曲率的降低和周边角膜曲率的增高。使眼睑对角膜的张力和压迫力集中在角膜周边而不是中央。所以眼睑无法更好的压迫角膜中央，使得中央角膜知觉敏感度降低泪液分泌减少。这在左眼和右眼的角膜地形图比较中更加明显。加之左眼偏中心切消，造成泪膜涂布的不均匀导致严重干眼症。有医生认为我的左眼角膜地形图上边曲率变化过于突然。角膜曲率从43D很快转变到33D。距离短没有过渡，容易造成上眼睑瞬目对角膜张力的不均衡和泪液涂布的不均衡。加上角膜中央知觉降低泪液分泌减少。角膜周边陡峭处容易与眼睑形成较大张力和摩擦，容易加重干眼和头疼等不适症状。
     
总之，这种非人类的痛苦整天折磨着我纠缠着我，使我无法忍受。我不想以死解脱。也不想把自己眼球挖出来来缓解疼痛。我一直觉得的还有希望。就是眼睛瞎了也要比这种痛苦好啊。就是换过角膜的人也没有像我这样这样痛苦啊。至少不会像我一样因为左眼疼痛和头疼还有干眼严重影响睡眠啊！我跑遍全国找过很多医生，他们也没有好办法，对我这种情况束手无策。医生会说：像我这种情况只有找第一次给你做lasik手术的大夫来帮你解决。他们会说：在哪家医院做的手术你去找哪家医院，让他们给你负责。可我多次找到我的手术医生和他所在的医院，他们也没有任何办法，并且很不负责任的告诉我：我的问题和他们手术没有任何关系。我现在真的是求医无门走投无路了。所以请求各位好心大夫们帮帮我，我真的是摘除眼球的心都有。希望大夫们能考虑各种手术来帮助我解决问题，包括板层角膜移植手术。希望大夫们能帮我恢复一些角膜中央厚度和中央曲率来挽救我的眼睛，不管用什么办法。如果手术能恢复。那么手术一切风险和后果由病人自己承担，可以找律师做公证。希望大夫们取消顾虑和担心。帮助我改善角膜中央形态。现在的我因为眼睛问题，因为每晚无法安睡，身体越来越差，精神恍惚记忆力下降。我的免疫力越来越差，各个脏器也开始出现问题，似乎全身的新陈代谢都出现问题。我的家人为我操碎了心。我的妻子非常善良，她始终不渝的陪在我身边照顾着我帮助着我。她越是这样我就越感到愧疚。因为我的病连累了她。有时我真想自己一走了之远离痛苦。但我担心我的家人会为我难过。担心我的妻子会孤独无助。家人总是鼓励我让我勇敢坚强的面对困难！我每时每刻都在提醒自己我的病会好转起来。可是一次次的积极治疗然后换回一次次的失败。一次次的求医问药却换回一次次医生们的冷漠对待。我那必胜的希望和信念不知还能坚持多久？

我的姐姐同样做了lasik近视手术。我们在一个医院做的手术。她手术前是600度近视。她手术后也有些干眼症。但是6个月后很快消失好转。我的表哥也做过lasik近视手术。手术前500度近视。手术后基本没有干眼症状。我的很多朋友也做过lasik近视手术。他们手术前基本都是500到600度近视，100到200度的散光。手术后一年内干眼症状都消失了。只有我的近视度数最高，达到1100度。术后只有我的干眼症一直没有好转。而且越来越糟糕。从2007年到今天，五年来我曾用过无数种方法治疗左眼疼痛头疼和干眼。在大夫的建议下用了很多很多很多方法却无济于事没有任何好转。五年来包括使用了各种人工泪液。包括进口的不含防腐剂的人工泪液。十分钟用一次的人工泪液。例如潇莱威，倍然，瑞星，海露等等买过不计其数但效果微乎其微。一直用泪道栓塞——包括泪点塞和泪道塞用过多次也无任何改善。还有隐形眼镜，用了保护角膜医用型零度镜和RGP，结果是越戴越糟，无法耐受。一直坚持用眼药——包括各种消炎药和环抱霉素都无好转，用过上百种消炎药可是用多了眼睛更加干燥。口服药物——用了包括刺激泪液分泌的西药和滋阴补肝血的中药等也无效果。只能是轻微缓解干眼症状，但对缓解左眼疼痛帮助不大。况且长期吃药会出现很大副作用，威胁到其他器官。一直坚持吃中药将近2年。但无法解决干眼疼痛问题。保健品——一直坚持吃各种维生素和叶黄素，好像无任何效果。坚持吃过一段时间的止痛的药物和精神类药物——包括各种抗抑郁抗焦虑药和促进睡眠的西药和中药等，除了脑子反应迟钝，但眼部疼痛并没有因此减轻。相反吃了这类药后眼睛更加干燥。治疗干眼还包括中医针灸和按磨和眼部的熏蒸等——包括眼部针灸和全身针灸调理，但都无实质性改善左眼疼痛和头疼问题。似乎只是心里上的安慰。还包括各种物理疗法，对左眼眼部消炎疗法，效果很短暂。以上方法均无法改善疼痛问题。左眼疼痛和左边头疼依旧无法缓解。严重时依然要用手掌按压角膜和眼球来缓解疼痛和头疼。在最无奈的情况下曾经想过做颌下腺移植手术来缓解。那是个大手术，移植后嘴巴会很干。可医生并不建议我这样做，因为我的泪腺和泪液分泌是好的。他们认为我的问题是角膜形态的问题和泪腺和泪液分泌无关。后来事实证明正如他们所说，我的问题正是角膜形态问题。

    在2011年8月24日，我做了左眼二次lasik手术。那是个治疗远视和散光的角膜地形图引导的(T-CAT)LASIK手术。术后角膜形态虽然只有一点改变，偏心得到一点纠正。但当时改善左眼疼痛和头疼还有改善干眼效果却非常明显。连睡眠也改善很多。后来我向医生提出再次lasik手术。视力我都不考虑。即便回到2007年前的1200度近视我非常乐意。即使戴上厚厚的眼镜我也非常高兴。关键是角膜形态。但医生说我角膜厚度已经剩余不多了。在这种情况下，我想到了做角膜基质微透镜植入填充手术。就是把切掉的角膜再补回来。虽然不可能完全回到2007年做lasik手术之前那样形态。但我想只要恢复一点形态，纠正一点偏心切削，增加一些角膜中央曲率都可以很好的解决我的问题。并且板层移植角膜技术已经很成熟，异体角膜排斥几率非常低，更何况微米计算厚的角膜角膜微透镜呢。我想在我原来的角膜瓣下填充一个600到800度左右的角膜微透镜来改善我的角膜形态。正如以前人们做500至600度近视的lasik手术后很少有人会得干眼，因为角膜形态和角膜中央曲率并没有太大改变。而近视在1000度以上的人做lasik手术后问题就会很多。正如医生所说角膜中央曲率太低会使眼睑张力和压力集中在角膜周边而不是中央。恢复角膜中央曲率降低周边曲率会根本改善泪液分布情况。如果填充效果不好的话还可以取掉。如果填充后真能完全解决我的问题直至变得越来越好，那么我的人生就不再是一个悲剧！未来和希望也不再渺茫！而且用这个方法还能帮助更多需要帮助的人！"

Then again i had lasik a on 6th January 2013 on left eye. Dr. Increased my zone to 8 mm & they said its maximum zone they can do but my halos starbust are still there & now i cannot read near things. I got nearsightedness problem also. Im very tensed & disappointed. If you have any solution please let me know. Dr saying your pupil size is large that is why you having these issues.

I queried the fact I had large pupils and dry eyes as I was concerned this could impact on the outcome, and they said it was nothing to worry about and wouldn’t affect the outcome. I foolishly believed them and proceeded with the surgery. I’ve been suffering with severe dry eye ever since and I’m left with permanent horrific night aberrations. Like a lot of people my eyesight also fluctuates greatly from day to day – a side effect that is yet to be taken more seriously. I receive very little sympathy from the surgery and at times they’ve been very reluctant to help. Do not believe a word these surgeons tell you – at the end of the day it’s a business, they’re there to make money, and they don’t care what the consequences will be for you! It needs to be banned...NOW!!!"

She also told me she had very dry eyes on this test but, not as dry as mine. My RN shared with me that she had Lasik and just used eye drops a few times a day(for approx. 2yrs). After checking with the doctor she said my eye dryness would not prevent me from having Lasik. The doctor came in and, said my eye dryness would not be an issue for the procedure.

I wish everyone who is pro lasik could be afflicted with burning and pain in their eyes like I have everyday.  Would they still then tout lasik?  This is torture.   

If you call dry eye a side effect when it prevents you from working, prevents you from enjoying life, and causes you to keep your eyes closed for 10 to 16 hours a day when before you were a happy person, you cannot distinguish the difference between a side effect and an injury.

992,01-17-2015,Cristina,Utale,Bucharest,,Romania,"I had Lasik in 2011. 
I recently read an article where a producer of laser equipment stated that only 2% of one of their market researches reported seeing or reading something about lasik and FDA, referring to the thousands of FDA testimonies of harmed people....basically has declared satisfied that the rest of 98% are not informed of the horror outcomes and immense risks of lasik.....this defines the market for which a 5% of bad outcomes is considered collateral damage...
I spent the first 6 months in an incredible pain both physic and psychic, not being able to take care of my little girl who back then had 6 months. Today I still cope with this chronic pain, it needs a lot of strength and patience.
Lasik is easy money gained by equipment producers, doctors, pharma, on one side..... by ruining people eyes and lives. This is atrocity encouraged by the authorities that should protect people health. 
Doctors choose ophthalmology as a residency because easy money are gained, surgeries are easy, not messy, take only 20 minutes and are very expensive....I quote the same doctor that performed my surgery ruining my eyes, the same doctor that gave me no after care, treating me like scum and brutally suggesting to turn on the lights when I complained of not being able anymore to see a proper contrast in dim lights and giving me some dry eyes drops to treat my excruciating pain, the same doctor that decided to have me had Lasik instead of Lasek (a less invasive procedure) because he knew better, didn't he? After all he was the doctor, so I trusted him cutting my eyes open. They failed to  diagnose or more probably decided to ignore an obvious chalazion, a clear indication of non performing lasik, one of the many conditions that higher the procedural risk, a risk that however is huge for a ''cosmetic procedure''. Days after procedure I was told that were others with similar outcomes and that they managed their condition with drops. I soon realized that this was not possible.....but they had important stuff to do, many other Lasik surgeries that day, many other high likely possibilities of future destroyed lives. Proper screening would drastically reduce the number of '' good candidates '' and this isn't in the best interest of the industry. 
I've  waited patiently the moment of the procedure since high school, I did it at 32 years being convinced that a procedure performed for so many years must be safe. I made the mistake to search on the internet for risks and not for complications, so I didn't see the bad and horrible outcomes, but only the misleading information of those who promote Lasik. 
Prior the procedure I was told that the slight dryness will last for 2 months and then back to normal....this was 3 years now and I am nowhere near normal....punctal plugs inserted....let alone the glare, starbursts, lack of contrast, eye fatigue, special ugly glasses that I have to wear to protect the little tears that I still produce.
There is no cure, I tried everything out of despair. This is life condition, a iatrogenic one. 
FDA should do its job and stop this crime! Better late than never. “Primum non nocere”, right?"
