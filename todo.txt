I built the MySQL Connector for C++, libmysqlcppconn7, and its development package, libmysqlcppconn-dev, by doing:

/usr/local/src $ sudo apt-get source --compile mysql-connector-c++

To use the MySQL Connector for C++ read:

http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17952_01/connector-cpp-en/connector-cpp-en.pdf


While the MySQL Connector for C++ examples are in

  /usr/local/src/mysql-connector-c++-1.1.3/examples

the wrapper classes don't seem complete.


Don't know how to set link configuration. Tried manually doing:

g++  -o dist/Debug/GNU-Linux-x86/csv-extractor build/Debug/GNU-Linux-x86/main.o -L/usr/lib/libmysqlcppconn.so.7.1.1.3

got:

 undefined reference to `get_driver_instance'
