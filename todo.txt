I built the MySQL Connector for C++, libmysqlcppconn7, and its development package, libmysqlcppconn-dev, by doing:

/usr/local/src $ sudo apt-get source --compile mysql-connector-c++

To use the MySQL Connector for C++ read:

http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17952_01/connector-cpp-en/connector-cpp-en.pdf


MySQL Connector for C++ examples are in:  /usr/local/src/mysql-connector-c++-1.1.3/examples
