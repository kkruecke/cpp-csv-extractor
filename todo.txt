big bug
-------

While it appears there may be a C++11 regex bug, it may be a Unicode issue as doing

$ file petition.csv

yields:

petition.csv: UTF-8 Unicode text, with very long lines

This makes sense as there are Chinese characters in the file. 

Questions
~~~~~~~~~

* What does Unicode means exactly? 
* What does ASCII mean? 
* How does C++11 support reading a Unicode file? 
* What regex functions does one use with Unicode?
* Do I need to store that textual data as Unicode strings in the database since there are Chinese and potentially other complex-character languages.

Read about move semantics to decide about "return" line at end of CsvReader::getMatches().

Finish C++11 version of database insert using mysql++3 to insert records and populate the petition database.

C++11 regex library tutorial
============================

See:

1. http://www.regular-expressions.info/stdregex.html
2. http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2079020

TODO: The regex is not capturing each comma separated match rather it is matching the whole line.

MySQL++ Class Library
=====================

$ sudo apt-get source --compile libmysql++-dev

This builds three .debs that can be installed by doing:

$ sudo dpkg -i libmysql++3_3.2.0+pristine-1_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i libmysql++-dev_3.2.0+pristine-1_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i libmysql++-doc_3.2.0+pristine-1_all.deb 

After installing update the apt and aptitude caches:

$ sudo apt-get update 
$ sudo aptitude update

Lucene++
========

$ sudo apt-get install  libboost-date-time-dev libboost-test-dev
$ sudo apt-get source --compile liblucene++-dev 

Then do the folowing: 

$ sudo dpkg -i liblucene++0_3.0.4-0ubuntu3_amd64.deb 
$ sudo dpkg -i liblucene++-contrib0_3.0.4-0ubuntu3_amd64.deb 
$ sudo dpkg -i liblucene++-dev_3.0.4-0ubuntu3_amd64.deb 
$ sudo dpkg -i liblucene++-doc_3.0.4-0ubuntu3_all.deb
