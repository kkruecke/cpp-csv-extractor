TODOes
======


The petition.csv is a Unicode UTF-8 file. Doing 

$ file petition.csv

yields:

petition.csv: UTF-8 Unicode text, with very long lines. 

Questions
~~~~~~~~~

* What does Unicode means exactly? 
* What does ASCII mean? 
* How does C++11 support reading a Unicode file? 
* What regex functions does one use with Unicode?
* Do I need to store that textual data as Unicode strings in the database since there are Chinese and potentially other complex-character languages.

ideas
~~~~~

The foreign language occuring in the petition can't be understood, so we won't keep it. Therefore just eliminate it.

Read about move semantics to decide about "return" line at end of CsvReader::getMatches().

Finish C++11 version of database insert using mysql++3 to insert records and populate the petition database.

MySQL++ Class Library
