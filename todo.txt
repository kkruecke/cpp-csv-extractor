TODOes
======

BUG: Code is failing fails in parseNextLine() regex_replace. The former two consecutive double quotes (within a quoted subsection) are now only one
double quote. This is due to the new format of the .csv from www.thepetitionsite.com. 
Note: After fixing the bug, remove the debug code.


How to Prepare Petition File
============================

Change the following characters:

1. No standard double quotes, like these--“a perfect candidate”--have to be changed to "a perfect candidate".
2. Some apostrophe's maybe need to be changed to the standard single quote.
3. Some other changes I've forgotten.

Convert to 8859-1 format:

iso-8859-1.csv is a converted version of the petition made with

$ iconv -f utf8 -t iso-8859-1 

To check that it displays correct in Spanish and other foreign languages as a ISO-8859-1 encoded web page, use the php code in ~/csv to do this.


For an overview of Unicode and command line techniques for converting it see: unicode.txt

Steps to buildl ibmysqlcppconn-dev libmysqlcooconn7
===================================================

Built the packages libmysqlcppconn7 and libmysqlcppconn-dev from source with g++ 4.9:

   kurt@kurt-QAL51:/usr/local/src$ sudo apt-get source --compile mysql-connector-c++

Purge any previously installed versions

   kurt@kurt-QAL51:/usr/local/src$ sudo aptitude purge libmysqlcppconn7 libmysqlcppconn-dev 

Install the just-built .deb versions

 kurt@kurt-QAL51:/usr/local/src$ ls libmysqlcppconn* | xargs sudo dpkg -i

libmysqlcppconn-dev contains a static library that has the code for ::get_driver_instance(). So you will need to link with two libraries:

  -lmysqlcppconn -lmysqlcppconn-static 

in that order; the static library must come second. To add these link libraries in Netbeans go Linker "Additional options" and add the two lines above.

The documentation is at http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-cpp/en/index.html

Basic file modification steps.
==============================

Use copy-petition.csv and make sure this is done:

1. Doing dos2unix on file
2. Do iconv -f utf8 --to-encoding ISO-9959-1 to do basic single character changes, but not foreign language changes, to the files.
3. Check it using PHP code. 
4. Correct the main.cpp code per above.

Other todoes
------------

* Read the mysql++ documentation at http://localhost/doc/libmysql++-doc/html/. Then try using a template query to do the insert.
* Read about move semantics to decide about "return" line at end of CsvReader::getMatches().

Finish C++11 version of database insert using mysql++3 to insert records and populate the petition database.

MySQL++ Class Library
=====================

$ sudo apt-get source --compile mysql-connector-c++

It will pick the correct source package.

This builds three .debs that can be installed by doing:

$ sudo dpkg -i libmysql++3_3.2.0+pristine-1_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i libmysql++-dev_3.2.0+pristine-1_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i libmysql++-doc_3.2.0+pristine-1_all.deb 

After installing update the apt and aptitude caches:

$ sudo apt-get update 
$ sudo aptitude update

Lucene++
========

$ sudo apt-get install  libboost-date-time-dev libboost-test-dev
$ sudo apt-get source --compile liblucene++-dev 

Then do the folowing: 

$ sudo dpkg -i liblucene++0_3.0.4-0ubuntu3_amd64.deb 
$ sudo dpkg -i liblucene++-contrib0_3.0.4-0ubuntu3_amd64.deb 
$ sudo dpkg -i liblucene++-dev_3.0.4-0ubuntu3_amd64.deb 
$ sudo dpkg -i liblucene++-doc_3.0.4-0ubuntu3_all.deb 
$ sudo dpkg -i <any others I forgot>
