libmysqlcppconn-dev libmysqlcooconn7 build steps
================================================

Trying C++ connector for MySQL. Built the packages libmysqlcppconn7 and libmysqlcppconn-dev from source, in order to compile and link against g++ 4.9:

   kurt@kurt-QAL51:/usr/local/src$ sudo apt-get source --compile mysql-connector-c++

Purge any previously installed versions

   kurt@kurt-QAL51:/usr/local/src$ sudo aptitude purge libmysqlcppconn7 libmysqlcppconn-dev 

Install the just-built .deb versions

 kurt@kurt-QAL51:/usr/local/src$ ls libmysqlcppconn* | xargs sudo dpkg -i


libmysqlcppconn-dev contains a static library that has the code for ::get_driver_instance(). So you will need to link with:

   -lmysql and -lmysqlcppconn

The example code is in the source package

   $ sudo apt-get source libmysqlcppconn-dev

The documentation is at http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-cpp/en/index.html

TODOes
======

copy-ptition.txt has Russion removed. It has the single quote that is not Latin-1 compliant converted to the Latin-1 ' character. It has some similar 
minor corrections. If Lucene/Solr can handle Unicode maybe I should keep copy-petition.tx as UTF8; otherwise, convert it to ISO-8859-1 and delete
non English comments or have them translated to English.

1. Unicode
----------

Listen to cppcon Unicode lecture at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0GK-9f4dl8,
in order to decide what to do about handling the petition file. I want the comments to be only in ASCII.

http://www.w3schools.com/charsets/default.asp

Use modified-petition.csv and make sure this is done:

1. Doing dos2unix on file
2. Removing first and last name by importing into excel then exporting them back into a csv file.
3. Running iconv -f UTF-8 -t ASCII and looking for characters that could not be converted.

2. PHP under Tomcat 
-------------------


Other todoes
------------

* Read the mysql++ documentation at http://localhost/doc/libmysql++-doc/html/. Then try using a template query to do the insert.
* Read about move semantics to decide about "return" line at end of CsvReader::getMatches().

Finish C++11 version of database insert using mysql++3 to insert records and populate the petition database.

MySQL++ Class Library
=====================

$ sudo apt-get source --compile libmysql++-dev

This builds three .debs that can be installed by doing:

$ sudo dpkg -i libmysql++3_3.2.0+pristine-1_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i libmysql++-dev_3.2.0+pristine-1_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i libmysql++-doc_3.2.0+pristine-1_all.deb 

After installing update the apt and aptitude caches:

$ sudo apt-get update 
$ sudo aptitude update

Lucene++
========

$ sudo apt-get install  libboost-date-time-dev libboost-test-dev
$ sudo apt-get source --compile liblucene++-dev 

Then do the folowing: 

$ sudo dpkg -i liblucene++0_3.0.4-0ubuntu3_amd64.deb 
$ sudo dpkg -i liblucene++-contrib0_3.0.4-0ubuntu3_amd64.deb 
$ sudo dpkg -i liblucene++-dev_3.0.4-0ubuntu3_amd64.deb 
$ sudo dpkg -i liblucene++-doc_3.0.4-0ubuntu3_all.deb 
$ sudo dpkg -i <any others I forgot>
