Videos and Articles on Unicode

A excellent introduction to Unicode and its limitations as a string class in C++11 listen to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0GK-9f4dl8,

Overview
========

ASCII is an single bytes, seven-bit encoding. It thus allows for the encoding of 128 (decimal values 0 through 127)characters, including the English alphabet. There are
other single byte, eight-bit encodings that extend ASCII, and that therefore support the encoding of 256 characters. One of the most popular is ISO-8859-1 or Latin-1,
which also have the Internet Assigned Number of ISO/IEC 8859-1:1998.

Unicode works by indicating (in various ways depending of the version of Unicode used) a hex value that maps to another hex value called a code point. The code point
represents the "concept" of a given character, as opposed to how it's is rendered as a glyph or font. 

UTF8 is the most common because it saves the most space. It is a variable lenth encoding, meaning some Unicode code points require more bytes--I believe from one to
three bytes--than others.

How to convert from UTF-8 to Latin-1 in C++11
=============================================

Option 1
--------

$ sudo apt-get install recode
$ recode UTF-8..latin1 *.php

Or 
$ iconv -t ISO88592 -f UTF8 myfile.txt > output.txt

Option 2
--------

From a post on Slashdot:

First convert UTF-8 to 32-bit Unicode.

// This is sampe code, from elsewhere, to do that.
Code to do so:

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <locale>
#include <codecvt>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    string utf8_str =  u8"z\u00df\u6c34\U0001d10b"; // or u8"z√üÊ∞¥ùÑã"
                        // or "\x7a\xc3\x9f\xe6\xb0\xb4\xf0\x9d\x84\x8b";

    cout << "original UTF-8 string size: " << utf8_str.size() << '\n';
 
    // the UTF-8 - UTF-32 standard conversion facet
    wstring_convert<codecvt_utf8<char32_t>, char32_t> cvt; // wstring_convert not part of g++ 4.9
 
    // UTF-8 to UTF-32
    u32string utf32_str = cvt.from_bytes(utf8_str);

    cout << "UTF-32 string size: " << utf32_str.size() << '\n';

    cout << "converted() == " << cvt.converted() << '\n';
}

Then keep the values that are in the range 0 through 255.

Those are the Latin-1 code points, and for other values, decide if you want to treat that as an error or perhaps replace with code point 127 (my fav, the ASCII "del") or question mark or something.

The C++ standard library defines a std::codecvt specialization that can be used,

template<>
codecvt<char32_t, char, mbstate_t>

C++11 ¬ß22.4.1.4/3: ‚Äúthe specialization codecvt <char32_t, char, mbstate_t> converts between the UTF-32 and UTF-8 encoding schemes‚Äù
