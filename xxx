Medical studies demonstrate that LASIK 'side effects' are common, and that adverse effects are universal.  LASIK surgeons do not fully inform potential patients, and are engaged in a cover-up. Clinical trials that the FDA relied upon were tainted by dishonest investigators."

I finally went to a different vision specialist who says he cannot correct the damage done by LASIK but fitted glasses to help some.

I also have permanent double vision in one eye due to a decentered ablation.
