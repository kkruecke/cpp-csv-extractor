I suffered permanen
 life-altering complications from LASIK.  I know of thousands of people who also had a bad outcome from LASIK.  Medical studies demonstrate that LASIK 'side effects' are common
 and that adverse effects are universal.  LASIK surgeons do not fully inform potential patients
 and are engaged in a cover-up. Clinical trials that the FDA relied upon were tainted by dishonest investigators."

I had LASIK on 10-23-10. Since then ( and prior to! ) had dry eyes. Burning in my one eye. Starbursts and halos too... It's important to stop this cause of present problems and future unknown problems! My doctor said I was a good candidate.  Well I was not and he doesn't wanna hear about my ' problems'.

I am permanently disabled as a result of Lasik.  My vision is 20/20 according to the ophthalmologist who mutilated my corneas.  He tells me the procedure was successful; howeve
 while viewing an object I see six (6) ghost images
 starbursts and halos around EVERY light source and the severe dryness negates the 20/20 correction.  My quality of my life has been RUINED

 halos
 diminished vision and a sensation of severe dry eyes.  Currently
 I am going through a period of severe photophobia and cannot drive or perform any activity in lighted conditions.  I would also like to make the point that it is not only LASIK that needs to be re-evaluated but the physicians' themselves that perform LASIK and provide no follow up care or responsibility to their patients that have negative and debilitating results."

 who did the procedure
 had me returning every 3 months for 8 years for checkups and i was told that nothing was wrong. I finally went to a different vision specialist who says he cannot correct the damage done by LASIK but fitted glasses to help some. My prescription has to be changed every 6 months to try to gradualy get my vision back the best it can be. I will always have vision problems since I had LASIK."

  I am disabled from my chosen profession by the 'temporary side effects'of this surgery which have lasted for years.  As a direct result of this surgery
  I no longer can see to drive at night and my night vision is obscured by huge starbursts and haloes.  I also have permanent double vision in one eye due to a decentered ablation.   This surgery also induced very painful dry eyes as well as a loss of multiple lines of best correctable vision.due to induced irregular astigmatism.  Despite all these permanent unfixable complications
  I am still considered a success by industry standards."

I had lasik done on my left eye and it is permanently damaged and no vision left in it. There are too many unscrupulous doctors lying to people about the lazy LASIK and they should all be in prison because they are criminals !  They don't give a hoot about their patients
 they only care about making huge profits and they know they are ruining their patient's life for EVER but keep on convincing people the LASIK is safe ....  The media is just as corrupted as these so-called doctors because they advertise LASIK on TV  and promoting it for these low life doctors .  I have no respect for these bastards nor do I trust any of these money hungry charlatans and the same goes for the FDA  who approved such dangerous surgery ."

Because the world has been dupe
 the LASIK industry used falsified studies using only the good outcomes
 and throwing away the bad outcomes
 in order to get FDA approval...they cited lies that 'there were no known long-term damages from LASIK' when they knew every flap never heals
 kills vital corneal nerves needed to generate tears
 further thins out corneas which progressivly ages the eye causing/inducing irregular higher order aberrations then needing corneal transplants
 all while causing it's victims escalated depression and some suicidal tendencies because there is no cure."

We have to ask ourselves 'do we really need LASIK now that we have a new and improved non-surgical vision correction procedure called OrthoKeratology (Ortho-K).'  Thousands of people in this country and around the world are choosing Ortho-K over Lasik; and still it is not being heavily advertised here in the U.S.   My guess is that 98% of the people who are having problems with Lasik were not given the option of Ortho-K.   The public must know they have options.  Doctor
 start offering this procedure to your patients.  To get updated/educated/training on the modern advancements of Ortho-K
 visit online the OrthoKeratology Academy of America."
